# M3 emThree Studio 15 IR collection

This is a collection of Impulse Responses profiled with LSP Profiler from a vintage M3 emThree Studio 15 Guitar Amp (date of manufacture unknown, purchased in the 70s by my father).

A modern Shure SM57 was used for the profiling capture.

## The Amp

The amplifier is a emThree M3 Studio 15 from the 70s. It's an italian made solid-state guitar amp (yes, no tubes), with a tiny 8" speaker.

By itself that amp sounds very clean, making pretty useless for crunch effects. However it's 8" sound and 2.5k brightness peak (controlled by the tone knob) makes it great for [rockabilly], [early rock], and more importantly for [lo-fi effects].

### Prerequisites

To use the IRs you'll need any convolver that can use mono IRs (so really just about any convolver). Though if you are on linux I recommend LSP Impulse Responses.


### File Naming

The 'For guitar amp use' folder contains IRs profiled with the volume knob on 1 (it's already loud with this amp) to minimize background noise (the amp was not grounded for that lo-fi flair).

The 'Extreme' folder contains IRs profiled with the volume cranked to the max, resulting in a bit of saturation of the amp in the 2.5k region. This is recommended for lo-fi effects.
